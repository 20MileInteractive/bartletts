    <h5>Ingredients:</h5>
     <p>
  		<ul>
  			<li>4 cups all purpose flour</li>
  			<li>Â½ teaspoon baking powder</li>
  			<li>1 lb butter (unsalted, room temp)</li>
  			<li>2 2/3 cup sugar</li>
			<li>5 eggs</li>
			<li>1 teaspoons vanilla</li>
			<li>2 tablespoons 888 rum</li>
		</ul>
    </p>

	<h5>Directions:</h5>
	<p>We make our own vanilla at the farm by scraping a dozen or so vanilla beans, and adding them along with their pods to a quart of vodka. We also have a quart of 888 bourbon and 888 rum, taking up residence on a shelf in the kitchen, both filled with vanilla beans. This very special extract finds its way into many of our baked goods as well as various salads and an occasional, celebratory glass.
	</p>

	<p>For this cake, we use the vanilla infused rum for both the cake batter and the simple syrup to soak the cake in just as it comes out of the oven.
	</p>

	<ol>
		<li>Blend all dry ingredients and set aside.</li>
		<li>In a mixing bowl, beat the butter into submission with the sugar until light and fluffy.</li>
		<li> Add the vanilla and rum to the eggs, and mix with a whisk to break yolks and blend.</li>
		<li>Add the egg mixture to the butter and sugar mixture, and blend till well mixed.</li>
	<li>Add the flour mixture, and blend only until well mixed.</li>
	<li>Pour the batter into a prepared bundt or tube pan, and bake in a preheated 350 degree oven for about 55 minutes.</li>
	<li>While the cake is baking, make a mixture of 1/2 cup water, 1/2 cup sugar. </li>
	<li>Bring to a boil, simmer for two to three minutes and set aside. </li>
	<li>Add one quarter cup rum (away from the flame.)</li>
	<li>Let cool to room temp. Pour from hot pan into a shallow dish or clean pan to help cool more quickly.</li>
	<li>When the cake comes out of the oven, use a skewer to poke holes from top to bottom all over the cake. Pour your rummy goodness all over the cake slowly to let it absorb. </li>
	<li>Let your cake sit in the pan for about a half an hour to absorb all of the syrup, then turn out onto a plate. A deeper dish or plate with a slight edge will help keep all the glorious rum syrup where it belongs!</li>

	</ol>
	<p>
	Enjoy!
